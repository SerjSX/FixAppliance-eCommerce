# FixAppliance bookingCommerce
 FixAppliance LB is an eCommerce web development project allowing users to either book technicians or read DIY articles written by freelancers. The idea of my eCommerce website follows the Business Model Canvas that I prepared in my eCommerce class, found here: https://github.com/SerjSX/FixAppliance-eCommerce/wiki/Business-Model-Canvas

# Features
- User and Technician dashboards, login and register forms
- Technician's register is form-like, so verified technicians are allowed only
- Technician can go through the process of accepting a pending booking, starting it, and then completing it after the user pays
- Technician has a dashboard allowing him/her to see their earnings both before and after cutting platform costs, and seeing a list of all bookings he/she has and had taken
- User has a dashboard allowing him to view his/her past bookings, and total spending
- User can request bookings of the available appliance types
- User can pay and review a booking
This list is subject to update.
